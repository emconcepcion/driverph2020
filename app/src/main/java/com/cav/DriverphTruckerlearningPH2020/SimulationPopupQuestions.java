            "Your brain recognizes a hazard AFTER your eyes see it. What is the distance your vehicle continues to travel in ideal conditions upon this reaction?",

            "Water is a slippery business. It can result in your vehicle hydroplaning, causing you to lose control as your tires lose traction or all contact with the road. So, take care when it's rainy or wet!",
            "When tires catch on fire, it's usually due to overheating. Under-inflated tires and dual tires that touch can cause this.",
            "While all of these options may give you a proper jolt, the only real solution to tiredness is clocking in some zzz's. Catching up on sleep will revive you and make you a more alert and refreshed driver.",
            "While most of these options are valid, safety should be every driver's top priority. So, when it comes to vehicle inspection, ensuring safety is the number one goal.",
            "Someone with road rage might escalate the situation, so instead of responding to them, it's best to ignore their tactics. Keep calm, ignore their gestures, try to get out of their path, and do NOT block them, gesture, or make eye contact.",
            "A long steep downgrade requires you to consider the vehicle's total weight, the length and steepness of the grade, the weather, and the road conditions. These will ensure safety on dangerous roads.",
            "Engine speed and road speed are the main indicators to shift gears. The higher the speed, the higher the gear.",
            "Driving requires alertness. Feeling drowsy or falling asleep on the open road can lead to accidents and even fatalities. Needless to say, sleep is very important to drivers, so keep in mind that during a 24-hour period, the average person needs 7 to 8 hours of sleep in order to be well-rested.",
            "Sure, you want your seat to be comfortable. But inspecting for seating defects is not a necessary step in a standard vehicle inspection. Rather, you should check for brake issues, tire issues, steering issues, suspension system defects, rim and wheel issues, exhaust system problems, and ensure that you have emergency equipment on board.",
            "While all these methods – apart from \"winging it\" – will aid you in reversing out of a tight spot, the best method is to use a helper. Your helper will be able to direct your every move while in the process of reversing.",
            "If you're driving slowly or you want to warn drivers of an approaching hazard, flashing your brake lights is a good way to signal these matters. However, doing the same for tailgaters might result in a crash, nor should your taillights be used as a turn signal or to warn drivers of police.",
            "Extreme heat can be dangerous for your vehicle, so it's important to check all three of these things more frequently when you're driving in hot environments. Check your tires every 100 miles or 2 hours, and if they're hot to the touch let them rest. Also, check your vehicle's antifreeze levels to ensure everything's running smoothly.",
            "Bad weather and mountainous terrain are no picnic for legal maximum weighted trailers. So, if safety is your priority, then keep this in mind when planning your route for this type of vehicle.",
            "When involved in a crash where you aren't injured, your number one objective should be to prevent further collision or injury. Taking care of those injured, notifying authorities, and securing the area is much more important than taking down everyone's contact information.",
            "DANGER! DANGER! You should never back towards the right side, as your vision is obstructed. Instead, reverse slowly towards the driver's side in the lowest reverse gear.",
            "The steering system includes the spindle, the tie rod, and the drag link, among other important parts. The master cylinder belongs to the braking system.",
            "You've probably seen open-bed trailers covered and secured, and there's good reason for that. The two main reasons are to protect other drivers from potential falling debris, and also to protect the cargo from rain, snow, wind, and other weather conditions that may damage it.",
            "While fueling and inspecting are skills you'll need as a driver, the four basic skills are accelerating, steering, stopping, and backing safely. Master these skills and you'll be well on your way to your CDL license.",
            "While road rage and aggressive driving are similar, road ragers intend to harm others, while aggressive drivers may simply be selfish on the road and unconcerned about others. You don't want to run into either on the open road.",
            "When traveling down a long, steep downgrade, slow your vehicle using engine braking. This will reduce your dependence on the vehicle's braking system so that you won't overstress your brakes.",
            "If you don't want to backroll on an incline, apply the parking brake. The other options won't achieve the desired effect; in fact, shifting to neutral will actually cause you to go backward.",
            "Emergency warning devices help block off an area so that other vehicles don't enter when there's a hazard. You should place your devices 100 feet ahead and behind the vehicle and within 10 feet of the front and rear corners.",
            "Front tires have a minimum legal tread depth of 4/32. Wheels on other axles have a minimum legal tread depth of 2/32.",
            "The braking distance is the reaction time between when you see a hazard and when you actually brake. Hopefully, your braking distance is narrow!",
            "Be cautious when crossing railroad tracks in these low vehicles, as they can all easily get stuck on the tracks. When you reach a crossing, make sure there's not a train in sight!",
            "The controlled braking method involves applying the brakes hard without locking the wheels. Steering movements should also be minimal when applying this method.",
            "Bad oil pressure indicates poor flow and can damage seals and other components. The accurate oil pressure range of an idling engine is between 5–20 PSI.",
            "Using the Heavy Vehicle Formula, you would need 4 seconds for a 40-foot truck going under 40 MPH. When your vehicle is traveling faster than 40 MPH, you add a second to this.",
            "4 car lengths (about 60 feet) won't give you the time you may need to react to an approaching hazard. 12-15 seconds, a city block, and .25 miles are equivalent and should allow you enough time to change lanes or come to a stop if need be.",
            "Wondering how far in advance to brake? The Heavy Vehicle Formula requires that every 10 feet of vehicle length under 40 MPH is one second. Add an additional second when driving over 40 MPH."
