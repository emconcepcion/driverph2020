    <string name="about_text">In partnership with QuickTrans Cargo Moving, Inc., located in Tondo, Manila, the Technological Institute of the Philippines Quezon City - College of Information Technology and Education (TIPQC - CITE) developed DRIVER.PH-TruckerLearningPH, a mobile learning application under the project: "Drivers Roadworthiness Improvement Verification Education Readiness for the Philippine Logistics Industry", that aims to educate and evaluate both professional and non-professional licensed vehicle drivers using categorized learning modules, videos, and tests that will enable them to be professionally competent and fully equipped with the essential knowledge of what a truck driver is expected to possess and apply in the trucking industry and on the road. The materials used in the application were derived from the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) competency standards and guidelines for TESDA NC III Driving (Passenger Bus/Straight Truck) certification. This mobile app is developed by a group of 4th Year BSIT Students of TIPQC - CITE.</string>
